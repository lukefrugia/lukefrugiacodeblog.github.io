    <h2>What was challenging about Assignment 3:</h2>
    <p>
      This was a challenging assignment for me. This was my first time scripting
      in Javascript, so it was a learning experience for me. The most
      challenging things I faced when writing
      <a href="index.html">Assignment 3</a> were:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Showing the modal.</li>
      <li>Creating the new post HTML with Javascript.</li>
      <li>Adding the data attributes to the posts.</li>
      <li>Adding new posts after learning how to refilter.</li>
      <li>Refiltering with <i>*all*</i> the posts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What I learned:</h2>
    <p>
      After I found the modal HTML and CSS, I learned how to change the CSS
      styling with Javascript from this
      <a
        href="https://medium.com/developerhelps/getelementbyid-display-none-faf96b4d24b0"
        >webpage</a
      >
      and implemented it in the buttonClickHandler and closePopup functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      It took me some googling to figure out how to add data attributes when I
      was creating new posts. Before I starting implementing refiltering, I
      added these new posts to the posts with getElementById("posts"). This
      broke because I was deleting everything in the posts div and using an
      NodeArray that stored the original posts to refilter. It ended up taking a
      bit of Googling and talking with
      <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a> to figure out that I needed
      to use Array.from to push a post to the array.
